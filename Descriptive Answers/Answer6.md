Arithmetic operators in JavaScript are used to perform basic mathematical operations. Here are the main arithmetic operators:

    - Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
    - Subtraction (-): Subtracts one number from another.
    - Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
    - Division (/): Divides one number by another.
    - Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of a division.
    - Increment (++): Increases a number by one.
    - Decrement (–): Decreases a number by one.
    - Exponentiation ()**: Raises a number to the power of another number.

 For example:   let a = 10;
                let b = 3;

                let addition = a + b;        // 13      (addition results in 13 because 10 + 3 = 13.)
                let subtraction = a - b;     // 7       (subtraction results in 7 because 10 - 3 = 7.)
                let multiplication = a * b;  // 30      (multiplication results in 30 because 10 * 3 = 30.)
                let division = a / b;        // 3.333...(division results in approximately 3.333 because 10 / 3 ≈ 3.333.)
                let modulus = a % b;         // 1       (modulus results in 1 because the remainder of 10 divided by 3 is 1.)
                let increment = ++a;         // 11      (increment increases a by 1, making it 11.) 
                let decrement = --b;         // 2       ( decrement decreases b by 1, making it 2.)
                let exponentiation = a ** b; // 1000    ( exponentiation results in 1000 because 11 raised to the power of 3 is 1000.)
