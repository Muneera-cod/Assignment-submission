When you concatenate a number and a string in JavaScript using the + operator, the number is converted to a string, and the two strings are joined together. 
For example:    let num = 42;
                let str = "The answer is ";
                let result = str + num; // "The answer is 42"
          
In this case, num is converted to the string "42", and then concatenated with str to produce "The answer is 42".
